  <h3 class="job-title">I work hard, study hard and am self-motivated. As soon as I entered the university, I was strict with myself and determined to make a difference in my college life and develop myself in an all-round way. I am a perfectionist, I know there is no perfect person in the world, but we can pursue, keep moving forward, everyone has shortcomings, I more or less compare these shortcomings to invisible holes, we all know that the hole can be filled, like the shortcomings can be corrected, and can be corrected, how can we fill the hole bit by bit. The hole is invisible, just like people will not be perfect, we may fill the hole forever, as if people will not be perfect, also like to learn, learning is endless. So I will continue to fill in the holes, continue to learn, continue to improve myself.
    Interests and expectations:
    In my opinion, interest is what we are willing to spend time and energy on. I think this course will be of great help to me. I hope that after learning this course, I can design some simple programs, such as web crawler and some programs related to data and image processing, which are conducive to my future study.</h3>
